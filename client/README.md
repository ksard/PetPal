# React Project

This folder includes the UI implementation for PetPal web application. We have used React to develop an interaction and elegant User Unterface. Below are the pre-requsites and steps to setup the client application in your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 20 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/infomediadesign/sad-01-24-petpal.git
    cd sad-01-24-petpal/client
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    If you're using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**

    If you're using npm:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
